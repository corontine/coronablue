# Coronablue

This web application will use Bluetooth api's provided by browsers to track users anonymously,
and provide notifications to other users when a user marks them as corona positive.

The notification also can include the date and time, so users can asses what they were
doing back then to apply informed solutions.

# Setup

Because it's an experimental api, google forces you to use a TLS connection.
Therefore, a local development environment requires https.
